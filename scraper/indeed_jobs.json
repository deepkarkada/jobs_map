  "description": "At Ello, our mission is to maximize the potential of all children. Our first product (Read with Ello) is an AI reading teacher that listens to a child read from real books. We’re now building on the success of Read with Ello and putting together the pieces of the world’s first complete AI teacher for children. We’re a highly technical team building delightful learner-centered experiences that leverage the most recent advances in AI. Our products put children on a path of lifelong learning, creating the foundation for their future and ours. Together, we believe we can close literacy and educational gaps around the world.\n \n  Who you’ll be joining\n  Ello’s 6-person Machine Learning team includes some of the world’s foremost experts in their areas. To give one example, our speech perception efforts are led by the co-authors of wav2vec. At Ello, they’ve built the world’s best child speech recognition system, beating Whisper. That ability to understand child speech reliably enables us to unlock the power of generative AI tools for early childhood learning. We work on a broad range of machine learning problems across NLP/NLU, image generation, and speech perception. We collaborate closely with advisors from Stanford and top industry research labs (on a weekly basis, not in some hands-off way). We work in-person out of our San Francisco office and we’re big believers in face-to-face collaboration.\n \n  About the role\n  As the Tech Lead on the ML team, you will work closely with the Co-Founder & CTO to lead the architecture design for all of our ML efforts. You will be in charge of MLops in collaboration with our Platform team and set good standards for your colleagues on critical design questions around dataset management, experiment tracking, and distributed training infrastructure. You will also get into the weeds as an IC, develop and review model and application code, and implement state-of-the-art machine learning systems for reading instruction, story generation, and interactive dialogue teaching.\n \n  You should have a strong background in software engineering and machine learning. We work on research problems on a production timeline. You will be successful in this role if you enjoy setting up scalable training systems and infrastructure from scratch and like shipping real-world products.\n \n  Most importantly, you are excited about the opportunity to make a real impact on child development at scale.\n \n  Responsibilities\n \n   Oversee the development and deployment of machine learning models to production environments\n   Lead by example, fostering a culture of excellence in architecture, coding, and model development\n   Provide guidance, regular feedback, education, and mentoring to other members of the ML team\n   Monitor and maintain deployed models and data pipelines\n   Independently lead research work streams as part of Ello’s ML team\n   Lead collaboration with platform and Unity engineers as well as TPM and data team on data collection, pipeline design, model training, and deployment\n   Continuously learn and stay up to date with the latest advancements in machine learning engineering\n \n \n  Required experience\n \n   4+ years experience as an ML engineer/researcher working with modern Machine Learning toolkits (Python stack, very comfortable with PyTorch)\n   2+ years of experience building, scaling, and optimizing ML systems\n   Experience setting up ML ops workflows and infrastructure from scratch in a startup environment (ideally in Terraform on AWS)\n   Production programming experience on a data-intensive project in distributed infrastructure\n   Experience deploying distributed data and training pipelines on Kubernetes\n   Experience with large language models\n   Experience writing high-performance, parallelized code\n   Applied mathematics and linear algebra proficiency at the level at which you can contribute to research discussions with a deeply technical team\n   Very accustomed to agile software engineering processes, git flow, etc.\n \n \n  Nice to have experience\n \n   Prior experience setting up GPU clusters (e.g. previously set up SLURM, or built multi-cloud model training pipelines with Infrastructure-as-Code)\n   Some familiarity with basic full-stack web development workflows and frontend API interaction\n   2+ years of experience leading teams developing ML solutions\n   On-device systems experience\n   \n     An understanding of low-level build pipelines and deployment experience in C/C++ or similar\n     Experience working with mobile operating systems and I/O pipelines in resource-constrained environments\n     Experience with optimizing neural networks to perform well on low-power mobile platforms (e.g. pruning, distillation, quantization)\n   \n   Signal processing background\n \n \n  We look for candidates who\n \n   Have something to teach us\n   Want to do work they are proud of to ship products they are proud of\n   Have an urge to make a real impact on child development at scale\n   Take initiative and full ownership of their work\n   Prefer open and direct communication grounded in empathy to beating around the bush\n   Exemplify integrity in their actions, decisions, and communication\n   Want to build meaningful relationships at work\n \n \n  Here are some reasons to be a part of our team\n \n   Help lead a small but rapidly growing team of A+ engineers in a well-funded company\n   Work at the cutting edge of interactive learning and artificial intelligence\n   Stay plugged in with the research community while building real-world products\n   Do meaningful work supporting child development that you can witness firsthand during in-office playtests. Make an edit in your jupyter notebook this week, deploy it on-device in C++ next week, and watch it bring smiles to kids’ faces a day later\n \n \n  A note on immigration\n  We don’t shy away from sponsoring US visas and green card petitions. Our CTO and CEO have each gone through their own immigration journeys and are familiar with the challenges. We have successfully secured O-1 visas, H-1B transfers, etc. for Ello employees and retain top immigration counsel.\n \n  About Ello\n  Ello is a public benefit corporation on a mission to maximize the potential of all children.\n \n  Our team has deep expertise in artificial intelligence, K-12 education, and child development across institutions such as Stanford, Berkeley, Google, Apple, and more. We were part of Y Combinator’s W20 batch and have recently closed a $15M series A led by Goodwater Capital, with major participation from Homebrew (returning investors), Reed Hastings, Common Sense Growth, and Ravensburger. This adds to existing funding led by Project A Ventures with additional investors including Reach Capital, Khosla Ventures, WndrCo, Visible Ventures, and K9 Ventures.\n \n  We’re a small, collaborative team that takes each other’s voices very seriously. Because our mission is to support all children, it is critical that our team is representative of the wider community; we place significant emphasis on ensuring diversity in our team and inclusion in our culture.\n \n  We want to create an environment in which we can all be our best selves, use our strengths to take Ello forward, and develop our own skills.

Our first product (Read with Ello) is an AI reading teacher that listens to a child read from real books. We&#x2019;re now building on the success of Read with Ello and putting together the pieces of the world&#x2019;s first complete AI teacher for children. We&#x2019;re a highly technical team building delightful learner-centered experiences that leverage the most recent advances in AI. Our products put children on a path of lifelong learning, creating the foundation for their future and ours.

  "description": "Innovation Fellowship: Artificial Intelligence and Governance\n  Center for Science and Democracy\n  Union of Concerned Scientists\n  Remote position\n \n  Our organization\n  The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) is an independent nonprofit that puts rigorous, independent science into action, developing solutions and advocating for a healthy, safe, and just future. We envision a peaceful, healthy, and just world where science serves people and the planet by guiding policy decisions, reducing risks, and improving lives.\n  For over five decades, we have been working as scientists, engineers, economists, advocates, and everyday people to create and advocate for innovative, practical solutions to some of our planet’s most pressing problems—from combating global warming and developing sustainable ways to feed, power, and transport ourselves, to fighting misinformation, advancing racial equity, and reducing the threat of nuclear war. Values informing our work include:\n  \n  Science in the service of people and the planet. \n  Justice and Equity for people of all races and incomes—now, and for future generations. \n  Courage to take principled, science-based stands in the public arena. \n  Integrity to always examine evidence critically, openly, and honestly. \n  Democracy to promote a voice for all in government decisions. \n  Action inspiring and mobilizing people to build a healthier, safer, and more just world. \n \n The Center for Science and Democracy in the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) seeks outstanding candidates for an Innovation Fellowship to create and lead a body of work to refine our understanding of the risks and benefits of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) on democratic governance and decision-making. This two-year fellowship is open to candidates who will have completed their Ph.D. or another advanced degree in a relevant field before September 2024, or those with equivalent experience.\n  At the Union of Concerned Scientists, we advance equitable science-based solutions to some of the world’s most pressing problems, conduct rigorous technical analyses, and mobilize our supporters to build powerful coalitions, educate decision-makers, and advocate for change. The Center for Science and Democracy (CSD) will host this Innovation Fellow. CSD works to ensure equity and meaningful public participation continue to be at the core of our efforts. Vital local voices and ecological knowledge shape our research and advocacy because experience shows that the resulting solutions are fairer, more effective, and more enduring. Our ultimate aim is that the systems, structures, institutions, and practices that govern the American people, places, and environments are evidence-based and serve the broadest public good.\n  Requirements\n  As an Innovation Fellow, you will work with UCS staff to develop a proposal for a two-year position that explores the potential risks and benefits of AI on democracy and decision-making structures. Justice & equity will be core to this work with a focus on ensuring that communities that are most impacted or at risk of the dangers of AI are at the governance decision-making table. Democracy will take front and center in this work as this project tackles the use of AI to promulgate disinformation, which can result in voices being lost in government decisions.\n  While the specifics of the project will be developed in collaboration with the chosen candidate, we envision that the fellow will conduct mixed-methods research in one, or more, of the following areas:\n  \n  Combatting AI-Generated Disinformation in Elections: How might these technologies affect US elections systems and processes? What regulations are needed to protect our democracy from AI-generated mis- and misinformation? What is the role of the federal government and Congress to protect our democracy from the risks of AI? \n  Defending Scientific Integrity: How might scientific integrity be impacted by AI? What should federal agencies be aware of as they begin implementing their new scientific integrity policies? What guidance criteria should be adopted into the OSTP’s scientific integrity framework on AI? \n  Advancing the Equity and justice Dimensions of AI: Who is most at risk of being impacted by generative AI tools and technologies? Are those most at-risk being invited to participate in government decision-making processes regarding AI? How can federal agencies better prioritize the needs of communities that will be most impacted by AI? \n \n The Innovation Fellow will also coordinate with staff in other programs to create a collaborative cross-programmatic exchange on artificial intelligence at UCS.\n  Work could include literature reviews and other exploration of existing scientific work in the space, identifying priority, policy-relevant research questions on the risks and benefits of Generative Artificial Intelligence on democratic governance and decision-making, conducting robust quantitative or qualitative analyses of existing or new data, identification and facilitation of partnerships with external organizations in the field, building relationships with other researchers, developing educational materials/ programs for UCS constituents, supporting advocates in implementing scientific knowledge in their advocacy, organizing or participating in events and briefings on the project topics, working with advocates to develop policy and research recommendations, and carrying out new research and/or pilot projects related to these topics. The Innovation Fellow will also coordinate with staff in other programs to create a collaborative cross-programmatic exchange on artificial intelligence at UCS.\n  An important aspect of this role will be identifying ways to ensure the work is sustainable and able to be continued after the end of your Fellowship.\n  Benefits\n  Qualifications and Experience\n  The ideal Innovation Fellow candidate would have a Ph.D. in the social sciences (public policy, psychology, political science, etc.) and expertise in artificial intelligence and governance, technology and democracy, or a similar field(s). Experience with science & public policy, disinformation, and/or federal policymaking is desirable. Candidates should have strong research skills, be able to identify key policy-relevant questions, and write and speak clearly for technical, policy, and non-technical audiences. Experience with rapid response communications, messaging, and/or community organizing is strongly preferred. An advanced degree or Ph.D. (or equivalent experience) in a relevant field must be completed before September 1, 2024.\n  An understanding of the inequities inherent in the scientific and policy fields is needed for this work. All candidates should have a demonstrated interest in Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, especially in science and advocacy.\n  You may spend extended periods at a computer. Depending on COVID-19 circumstances, occasional travel may be required. Your safety and the safety of others is our first priority.\n  UCS is an equal-opportunity employer continually seeking to diversify its staff. In particular, we’re dedicated to broadening opportunities for individuals from demographic groups that are historically underrepresented in the sciences and in environmental advocacy. We’re also committed to building an inclusive workplace culture where talented people of widely diverse backgrounds can thrive. We've adopted this commitment because we believe the inclusion of culturally diverse perspectives will improve our work and produce better societal and environmental outcomes for all, including historically disenfranchised communities. We are actively seeking people who bring diverse backgrounds and perspectives to join us in this work. \n About the UCS Science Fellows Program\n  The UCS Science Fellows Program was established originally to honor Nobel Prize-winning physicist Henry Kendall who was with UCS from our beginnings and was the long-time chair of our board. Kendall was known for his unique ability to shake up the status quo and catalyze new thinking. Priority is given to innovative and forward-looking proposals that are primarily scientific, technical, or analytic but also show interest in the application of science to policy. Fellows will benefit from the opportunity to learn from the UCS approach to science and policy, and UCS will benefit from the new approaches and expertise of the Science Fellows.\n  More about the team\n  Our team is made up of a dedicated group of researchers, scientists, communicators, campaigners, and advocates from wide-ranging backgrounds and experiences.

  "description": "Anthropic is developing AI assistants that are helpful, harmless, and honest. As usage of our AI services grows, we need to ensure they are not misused. The T&S team is at the forefront of protecting our users from ethical, technical, and social risks from generative AI as well as ensuring that our users abide by Anthropic’s Acceptable Use Policies. The T&S team at Anthropic builds protections for new AI features enabled by the research teams and protects new products and surfaces developed by our product teams.\n \n \n \n   We're looking for an experienced leader to lead the T&S Engineering team. As the head of T&S engineering you will be responsible for: building detection systems to detect adversarial users, violative sessions, abusing prompts as well as violating completions generated from the model; building the software and data infrastructure to aid in detecting, reviewing, actioning, and recording T&S actions; building systems that scale with Anthropic’s growth, make design decisions that enable safe deployment of Anthropic’s model on claude.ai, first-party API and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP; collaborating deeply with research, product, and external partners to ensure robust and timely T&S coverage; partnering closely with Anthropic’s product policy, detection and enforcement teams building and growing a world-class T&S engineering team participating in ensuring that Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling Policies are met at each safety level\n \n \n \n   About Anthropic \n \n \n  Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that’s working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our customers and for society as a whole. Our interdisciplinary team has experience across ML, physics, policy, business and product.\n  \n Responsibilities:\n \n   Lead the engineering teams to ensure high precision and recall detection across content, accounts, and behavioral abuse. \n  Develop systems to help identify new attack patterns\n   Develop ubiquitous T&S coverage across all deployments - claude.ai, 1P API, and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP\n   Lead building of highly adaptable T&S systems so that new kinds of attacks can be detected and actioned quickly\n   Develop a T&S engineering system for reviewing, actioning, and recording all entities flagged and/or actioned by T&S\n   Work closely with research teams (e.g., alignment, interpretability, frontier and societal impact red-teaming) to build industry leading T&S detection\n   Collaborate with product engineering teams (API, applications, platforms, security, and inference teams) to enable T&S protections for all surfaces and products\n   Design T&S specific processes for engineering to respond to escalations \n  Collaborate with Data Science to develop, track, and act on metrics.\n   Build, coach, and mentor the T&S engineering team members to be able to help Anthropic achieve the mission of building the safest AI\n \n  You may be a good fit if you:\n \n   Have 6+ years in an engineering management role, leading teams building integrity, trust and safety, or anti-fraud/abuse systems\n   Have experience in designing and building T&S systems like flagging, reviewing, actioning, and recording systems for T&S\n   Have deep experience in detection techniques for content, scaled attack, bot detection, account fraud, misinformation, and/or harmful user-generated content\n   Have the ability to balance speed and precision when responding to attacks and evaluating risk\n   Have excellent communication skills to explain threats and tradeoffs to stakeholders\n   Have people management skills in coaching, recruiting, and developing engineers\n   Have experience designing operational processes around on-call, post-mortems, etc.\n \n  Strong candidates may also:\n \n   Have a background in building systems at scale with a focus on reliability and performance\n   Have experience with AI/ML and understanding how models can be manipulated\n   Have knowledge of common internet communities, and adversaries like spammers, fraud rings, and their evolving techniques\n   Have experience in designing and building systems across multiple cloud platforms\n   Use technical depth to assess and improve system designs\n   Have project management skills to balance priority tradeoffs\n \n \n  Annual Salary (USD)\n \n   The salary range for this position is $400-485K. \n \n \n  The salary range for this position is $400-485K. \n \n \n  Logistics\n \n \n   Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.\n \n \n \n   Deadline to apply: None. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.\n \n \n \n   US visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.\n \n \n \n   We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.\n \n \n \n   Compensation and Benefits*\n \n \n   Anthropic’s compensation package consists of three elements: salary, equity, and benefits. We are committed to pay fairness and aim for these three elements collectively to be highly competitive with market rates.\n \n \n \n   Equity - On top of this position's salary (listed above), equity will be a major component of the total compensation. We aim to offer higher-than-average equity compensation for a company of our size, and communicate equity amounts at the time of offer issuance.\n \n \n \n   US Benefits - The following benefits are for our US-based employees:\n \n \n  Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.\n  Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance for you and all your dependents.\n  401(k) plan with 4% matching.\n  21 weeks of paid parental leave.\n  Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!\n  Stipends for education, home office improvements, commuting, and wellness.\n  Fertility benefits via Carrot.\n  Daily lunches and snacks in our office.\n  Relocation support for those moving to the Bay Area.\n \n \n \n   UK Benefits - The following benefits are for our UK-based employees:\n \n \n  Optional equity donation matching at a 3:1 ratio, up to 50% of your equity grant.\n  Private health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your dependents.\n  Pension contribution (matching 4% of your salary).\n  21 weeks of paid parental leave.\n  Unlimited PTO – most staff take between 4-6 weeks each year, sometimes more!\n  Health cash plan.\n  Life insurance and income protection.\n  Daily lunches and snacks in our office.\n \n \n \n   This compensation and benefits information is based on Anthropic’s good faith estimate for this position as of the date of publication and may be modified in the future. Employees based outside of the UK or US will receive a different benefits package. The level of pay within the range will depend on a variety of job-related factors, including where you place on our internal performance ladders, which is based on factors including past work experience, relevant education, and performance on our interviews or in a work trial.\n \n \n \n   How we're different\n \n \n   We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.\n \n \n \n   The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.\n \n \n \n   Come work with us!\n \n \n   Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.",

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact &#x2014; advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI &#x2014; rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&apos;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br> The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <b><br> Come work with us!</b>\n </div>\n <div>\n   Anthropic is a public benefit corporation based in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.\n </div>\n</div>",

And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).\n   \n   We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way.
